This is a plugin for [Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com) 2.4 and 2.5, enabling support for [ReactiveMongo](http://reactivemongo.org) â€“ a reactive, asynchronous and non-blocking Scala driver for MongoDB.


## Usage

In your `project/Build.scala` or `build.sbt`:

```scala
// only for Play 2.5.x
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.reactivemongo" %% "play2-reactivemongo" % "0.11.11"
)

// only for Play 2.4.x
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.reactivemongo" %% "play2-reactivemongo" % "0.11.11-play24"
)
```

ReactiveMongo for Play 2 can be built from this source repository.
