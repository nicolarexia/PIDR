The PLM software was written internally by the team. This software is

The pedagogical material distributed with the PLM is covered both by
the GPLv3 license (mainly for the included code) and by the CC-BY-SA
license (mainly for the other media files). But the exact boundary
here between the source code and the media is left as an exercise to
the reader, so this material is distributed under both licenses for
sake of simplicity.

files is listed below.

 img/btn-reset.png is a mashup of mine between btn-start.png (CC-BY-SA) and
 http://openiconlibrary.sourceforge.net/gallery2/?./Icons/actions/run-rebuild.png
 (LGPL-2.1). The result can be used under either licence.
 
 Several exercises provide screenshot of PLM itself to help the
 student. These images are naturally CC-BY-SA too.

We borrowed the following icons, that are CC-BY-SA too:

The following images come from the LibreOffice icon set. They are thus
MPL-1.1 | GPL-3+ | LGPL-3+

The following logos are GPLv2:
 img/busyicon/*: (gnome) http://openiconlibrary.sourceforge.net/gallery2/?./Icons/animations/process-working.png

 img/world_turtle.png : stolen to the kturtle project, that is GPLv2+

=========================================================================

The logos of the programming languages are certainly free, even if I
didn't dig for their exact licence.

Public domain images (CC0 PD)

* img/focus_* These images were retrieved from http://openclipart.org/
              even if I didn't write down the exact URL for them.
* img/trophy.png         http://openclipart.org/detail/48937/trophy-by-sheikh_tuhin	     
* img/world_baseball.png http://openclipart.org/detail/76927/baseball2-by-shokunin

=========================================================================

The following images are believed to be free, even if I cannot
remember where they come from. We should maybe play safe and replace
them. But as you can see from the rest of the project, we are
better programmers than designers... You are welcome if you can help.

* src/lessons/sort/pancake/img/world_pancake.png 
  It was retrieved from 
  http://omgwtflols.deviantart.com/art/Pixel-Art-Pancakes-with-syrup-298700868
  It seems rather free, but the exact license is not known.
* img/world_lesson.png
  I cannot remember where it comes from. It looks very similar to the
  logo for education applications in KDE so I guess it's ok. And since
  I'm planning at removing the whole concept of lessons, it's probably
  not worth digging any further on this one.
